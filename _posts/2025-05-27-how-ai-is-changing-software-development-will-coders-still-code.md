## Introduction

The realm of software development is undergoing a radical transformation, driven by advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). From automating mundane coding tasks to enabling predictive analytics for software quality, AI is set to reshape not just how software is built, but who builds it. The pressing question many in the tech industry are asking is: "Will coders still code?" In this guide, we explore how AI is changing the landscape of software development, the roles of developers, and whether traditional coding skills will still be relevant.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this guide, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of software development concepts 
- Familiarity with programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- An account with an AI platform (such as Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS)
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Development environment (IDE or text editor)

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of AI-enabled software development can be summarized in the following workflow:

1. **Code Generation**: AI tools generate code snippets based on natural language descriptions or existing code.
2. **Code Review**: AI conducts automated reviews, ensuring code quality and adherence to standards.
3. **Automated Testing**: AI crafts test cases and performs regression testing to identify bugs.
4. **Deployment**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools use AI to manage deployment environments dynamically.
5. **Monitoring & Maintenance**: AI analyzes performance metrics and user feedback to predict necessary updates.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up AI Tools

- Choose an AI service provider (like Azure AI).
- Create an account and set up your environment.
- Familiarize yourself with the platform's workspace.

### Step 2: Integrating AI in Code Generation

- Use an AI code generation tool (such as GitHub Copilot).
- Input natural language prompts to generate code snippets.
  
### Step 3: Implementing AI for Code Review

- Integrate tools that provide AI-driven code review (like SonarQube).
- Set up automated checks to identify bugs and inefficiencies in your code.

### Step 4: Conducting Automated Testing

- Utilize AI for generating and executing tests (e.g., Test.ai).
- Automate the testing process and analyze the results.

### Step 5: Incorporating CI/CD with AI

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline that integrates AI tools for continuous integration and deployment.
- Monitor the pipeline's performance and adjust as necessary.

### Step 6: Gathering Feedback for Continuous Improvement

- Use AI to analyze user feedback and performance metrics.
- Iterate on your software to include enhancements based on AI insights.

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of using an AI tool to generate a basic Python function:

```python
# Using OpenAI's GPT for code generation
def generate_code(prompt):
    return prompt  # Pseudo-code for generating code snippet

# Example prompt 
ai_prompt = "Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number."

# Generated Response (simulated)
generated_code = generate_code(ai_prompt)

print(generated_code)
```

In real scenarios, the AI service would provide a complete function based on the prompt, handling complexities that a typical developer might struggle with.

## Cleanup

After completing the development process, ensure to revert any temporary settings and remove any test artifacts created during the process. Also, adjust your CI/CD configurations to maintain optimal functionality without unnecessary clutter.

## Conclusion

As AI tools become increasingly integrated into the software development process, their impact on what developers do is profound. Although traditional coding skills will still be needed, the role of the coder is evolving towards a more strategic and creative focus rather than just syntax and structure. Learning to leverage AI tools effectively will be vital for retaining relevance in the software industry.
