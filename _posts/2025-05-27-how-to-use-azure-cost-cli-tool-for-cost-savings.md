## Introduction

Managing cloud costs in Azure can be challenging, especially when resources scale dynamically. The `azure-cost-cli` tool helps analyze and optimize your Azure spending, providing insights into where your budget is going and how you can save money. This guide will take you through the steps needed to set up and use this tool effectively.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An active Azure subscription with sufficient permissions to access cost data.
- Azure CLI installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so from the [Azure CLI official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- PowerShell installed.
- Basic knowledge of PowerShell and Azure resource management.

## Architecture Overview

The `azure-cost-cli` tool allows you to pull cost data directly from your Azure account. It integrates with Azure's Cost Management APIs to fetch billing and usage data, and it analyzes this data to provide actionable insights for cost optimization.

1. **Data Retrieval**: The tool connects to Azure APIs to fetch your resource usage data.
2. **Analysis**: The retrieved data is analyzed to identify potential cost savings.
3. **Reporting**: Generates reports that highlight where savings can be made.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install azure-cost-cli

To get started, open your PowerShell terminal and run the following command to install the `azure-cost-cli`:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name azure-cost-cli -AllowClobber -Force
```

### Step 2: Login to Azure

Use the Azure CLI to log in to your Azure account:

```powershell
az login
```

### Step 3: Fetch and Analyze Costs

You can now use the `azure-cost-cli` tool to fetch your current Azure spending and analyze it. Run the following command:

```powershell
Get-AzureCost -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) -EndDate (Get-Date)
```

This command retrieves cost data for the past 30 days.

### Step 4: Review Suggestions

After running the analysis, the tool may provide suggestions for reducing costs. Review these recommendations and decide which actions to implement.

### Step 5: Implement Changes

Based on your analysis, you may want to resize or shut down unused resources, change your pricing plan, or apply any other cost-saving measures suggested by the tool.

## Code Example

Hereâ€™s a complete code example to illustrate how you can utilize the `azure-cost-cli`:

```powershell
# Import the module
Import-Module azure-cost-cli

# Login to Azure
az login

# fetch cost data for the last month
$costData = Get-AzureCost -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) -EndDate (Get-Date)

# Output the cost data
$costData | Format-Table

# Review cost-saving suggestions
$costSavings = Get-AzureCostSavings -CostData $costData
$costSavings | Format-Table

# Display suggestions
Write-Host "Suggested actions to optimize costs:"
$costSavings.Suggestions
```

This will analyze your Azure costs and provide you with a list of suggested actions to help you save money.

## Cleanup

After you've finished using the tool and have analyzed your costs, consider cleaning up any resources that you no longer need. You can do this through the Azure portal or using commands in the Azure CLI.

By following this guide, you should be able to effectively use the `azure-cost-cli` tool to analyze your Azure spending and identify potential cost-saving measures. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on your usage patterns will help ensure that your Azure expenditures remain efficient and within budget.
