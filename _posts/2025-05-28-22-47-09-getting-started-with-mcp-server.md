## Introduction

The Managed Code Platform (MCP) server provides an efficient solution for building and deploying applications in the cloud environment. Utilizing Azure's comprehensive resources, developers can harness the power of cloud computing while maintaining reliability and scalability. This guide will lead you through setting up an MCP server on Azure, highlighting essential steps and best practices.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An active Azure account. You can create one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
- Basic understanding of Azure services, virtual machines, and networking concepts.
- Azure CLI installed on your local machine. You can download it from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for editing configuration files.

## Architecture Overview

The MCP server architecture typically consists of several components:

- **Azure Virtual Machine (VM)**: This acts as the host for your MCP server.
- **Azure Storage**: For persistent data storage and backup.
- **Azure Networking**: Manages traffic flow and security.

The following diagram illustrates the architecture:

```
+-------------------+       +----------------+
|  Azure VM         | <--> |  Azure Storage  |
|                   |       |                |
+-------------------+       +----------------+
        |                          |
        |                          |
+-------------------+       +----------------+
|  Azure Network    |       |   MCP Server   |
|                   |       |                |
+-------------------+       +----------------+
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a Resource Group

First, create a resource group to manage all your Azure resources:
```bash
az group create --name myMCPResourceGroup --location eastus
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine

Next, create a VM that will host the MCP server:
```bash
az vm create \
  --resource-group myMCPResourceGroup \
  --name myMcpVM \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys
```

### Step 3: Configure Networking

Open necessary ports for your MCP server:
```bash
az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myMCPResourceGroup --name myMcpVM
az vm open-port --port 443 --resource-group myMCPResourceGroup --name myMcpVM
```

### Step 4: Install MCP Server Dependencies

SSH into your VM and install required software:
```bash
ssh azureuser@<PublicIP>

# Update your package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker
sudo apt install docker.io

# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Step 5: Deploy MCP Server

Pull and run the MCP server container:
```bash
sudo docker pull <mcp-image>
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 <mcp-image>
```

### Step 6: Verify the Installation

Visit the public IP of your VM in a web browser to verify that your MCP server is running:
```
http://<PublicIP>
```

## Code Example

Here’s a configuration example for a simple Docker-based MCP server:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official node image
FROM node:14

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy app source code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the app
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Cleanup

Once you’re done experimenting with the MCP server, you can delete the resource group to avoid incurring costs:
```bash
az group delete --name myMCPResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```

---

## Conclusion

Setting up an MCP server on Azure can enhance your development and deployment process, enabling you to leverage Azure's robust infrastructure. By following this guide, you have laid the groundwork for using the Managed Code Platform effectively.
