<meta name="description" content="Introduction Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development, enabling teams to automate the deployment of applications and infrastructure. In this post, we’ll set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps using multi-stage YAML to deploy Terraform-managed infrastructure. By the end of this guide, you’ll understand how to automate your infrastructure provisioning and management efficiently. Prerequisites Before we begin, ensure you have the following tools and resources in place: An Azure account with appropriate permissions to create resources An Azure DevOps organization and project A basic understanding of Terraform and its configuration files Azure DevOps CLI and Terraform installed locally for local testing Step-by-Step Guide Step 1: Set Up Your Azure DevOps Project Create a New Azure DevOps Project: Navigate to your Azure DevOps organization. Click on “New Project” and provide a name (e.g., terraform-ci-cd). Choose visibility settings for your project (Public or Private). Create a Repository: Inside your newly created project, go to the “Repos” tab and create a new repository. Initialize it with a README file if required. Step 2: Add Terraform Configuration Files Next, create the Terraform configuration files that define your infrastructure. Create a folder named terraform in your repository. Create a file named main.tf inside the terraform directory. Example main.tf: provider &quot;azurerm&quot; { features {} } resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;example&quot; { name = &quot;example-resource-group&quot; location = &quot;East US&quot; } Step 3: Create a Service Connection in Azure DevOps To allow Azure DevOps to deploy resources in your Azure account: Go to your project settings in Azure DevOps. Navigate to “Service connections”. Click on “New service connection” and choose “Azure Resource Manager”. Follow the prompts to authenticate and create the service connection with your Azure subscription. Step 4: Create the CI/CD Pipeline Using Multi-Stage YAML In your repository, create a new file named azure-pipelines.yml. This file will define your CI/CD pipeline. trigger: - main stages: - stage: Build displayName: &#39;Build Stage&#39; jobs: - job: TerraformInit displayName: &#39;Terraform Init&#39; pool: vmImage: &#39;ubuntu-latest&#39; steps: - script: | terraform init displayName: &#39;Initialize Terraform&#39; - job: TerraformPlan displayName: &#39;Terraform Plan&#39; dependsOn: TerraformInit pool: vmImage: &#39;ubuntu-latest&#39; steps: - script: | terraform plan -out=tfplan displayName: &#39;Plan Terraform Changes&#39; - stage: Deploy displayName: &#39;Deploy Stage&#39; dependsOn: Build jobs: - job: TerraformApply displayName: &#39;Terraform Apply&#39; pool: vmImage: &#39;ubuntu-latest&#39; steps: - script: | terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan displayName: &#39;Apply Terraform Changes&#39; Step 5: Commit and Push Your Changes Add your changes to Git. Commit your files with a meaningful message, e.g., “Add Terraform files and pipeline configuration”. Push your changes to the Azure DevOps repository. Step 6: Run Your Pipeline Navigate to the “Pipelines” tab in Azure DevOps. You should see your pipeline triggered automatically by your latest commit. Monitor the pipeline’s progress, and check for any errors. If successful, you will have deployed the infrastructure defined in your main.tf file! Code Example Here’s an overview of the Terraform code used in this tutorial: provider &quot;azurerm&quot; { features {} } resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;example&quot; { name = &quot;example-resource-group&quot; location = &quot;East US&quot; } This simple Terraform configuration creates a Resource Group in Azure.

  <li>Create a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.tf</code> inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform</code> directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.tf</code>:</p>

<div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">provider</span> <span class="s2">"azurerm"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">features</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">resource</span> <span class="s2">"azurerm_resource_group"</span> <span class="s2">"example"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">name</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"example-resource-group"</span>
  <span class="nx">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"East US"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-3-create-a-service-connection-in-azure-devops">Step 3: Create a Service Connection in Azure DevOps</h3>

<p>To allow Azure DevOps to deploy resources in your Azure account:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to your project settings in Azure DevOps.</li>
  <li>Navigate to “Service connections”.</li>
  <li>Click on “New service connection” and choose “Azure Resource Manager”.</li>
  <li>Follow the prompts to authenticate and create the service connection with your Azure subscription.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-4-create-the-cicd-pipeline-using-multi-stage-yaml">Step 4: Create the CI/CD Pipeline Using Multi-Stage YAML</h3>

<p>In your repository, create a new file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">azure-pipelines.yml</code>. This file will define your CI/CD pipeline.</p>

  <li>Add your changes to Git.</li>
  <li>Commit your files with a meaningful message, e.g., “Add Terraform files and pipeline configuration”.</li>
  <li>Push your changes to the Azure DevOps repository.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-6-run-your-pipeline">Step 6: Run Your Pipeline</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the “Pipelines” tab in Azure DevOps.</li>
  <li>You should see your pipeline triggered automatically by your latest commit.</li>
  <li>Monitor the pipeline’s progress, and check for any errors. If successful, you will have deployed the infrastructure defined in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.tf</code> file!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="code-example">Code Example</h2>

<p>Here’s an overview of the Terraform code used in this tutorial:</p>

<div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">provider</span> <span class="s2">"azurerm"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">features</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="nx">name</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"example-resource-group"</span>
  <span class="nx">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"East US"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This simple Terraform configuration creates a Resource Group in Azure. You can extend this to include more resources as needed for your infrastructure.</p>
